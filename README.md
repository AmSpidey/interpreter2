# interpreter
Interpreter additionaly contains:

- typechecker (4p)
- global and local variables, same for functions (2p)
- break and continue (masked as finish and repeat) (1p)
- the promised earn and spend mechanism (2p?)

My Latte Interpreter is a stack project. Here is more about stack: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

To run build the project with 'stack build' and then run it with 'stack run'.
